# Painters Problem 
We have to paint n boards of length {A1, A2â€¦An}. There are k painters available and each takes 1 unit time to paint 1 unit of the board. The problem is to find the minimum time to get this job done under the constraints that any painter will only paint continuous sections of boards.
